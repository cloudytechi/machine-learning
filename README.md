# Machine Learning Tutorial

Seems like you would have stumbled upon the term machine learning and must be wondering what exactly it is. Well, this machine learning tutorial will clear out all of your confusion!

Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence with the help of which you can perform magic! Yes, you read it right. Let’s take some real-life examples to understand this. I believe all of you must have heard of Google’s self-driving car. A car that drives by itself without any human support; that is just amazing, isn’t it?

Now, how about virtual personal assistants such as Apple’s Siri or Microsoft’s Cortana? If you ask Siri what is the distance between Earth and Moon, it will immediately reply that the distance is 384,400km.

You also must have used Google maps. If you want to go from New Jersey to New York via road, google maps will show you the distance between these two places, the shortest route and also how much traffic is there along the road.

Now, if you are interested in doing an end-to-end certification course in Machine Learning, you can check out Intellipaat’s [Machine Learnining Course](https://intellipaat.com/machine-learning-certification-training-course/) with Python.

Now, you would agree with me that all of these are some magical applications, and the magic behind these applications is machine learning. So, simply put, machine learning is a sub-domain of artificial intelligence, where a machine is provided data to learn and make insightful decisions.

Now, that we have understood what is machine learning, let’s go ahead in this machine learning tutorial and look at the types of machine learning algorithms:

Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning
Semi-supervised Learning
Reinforcement Learning
Now, let’s go ahead and understand each of these machine learning algorithms comprehensively.

Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the machine learns from the labeled data, i.e., we already know the result of the input data. In other words, we have input and output variables, and we only need to map a function between the two. The term “supervised learning” stems from the impression that an algorithm learns from a dataset (training). Here, the input is an independent variable, and the output is a dependent variable. The goal is to generate a mapping function that is accurate enough so that the algorithm can predict the output when we feed new input. This is an iterative process. Each time an algorithm makes a prediction, we need to check its performance. If it is not ideal, we have to keep repeating the process.

Let’s take this example to understand supervised learning in a better way.

So, this is an apple, isn’t it? Now, how do you know, it’s an apple? Well, as a kid, you would have come across an apple and you were told that it’s an apple and your brain learned that anything which looks like that is an apple.

Now, let’s apply the same analogy to a machine. Let’s say we feed in different images of apples to the machine and all of these images have the label “apple” associated with them.

Similarly, we will feed in different images of oranges to the machine and all of these images would have the label “orange” associated with them. So, here we are feeding in input data to the machine which is labeled.

So, this part in supervised learning, where the machine learns all the features of the input data along with it’s labels is known as ‘training’.

Once, the training is done, it will be fed new data or test data to determine, how well the training has been done.

So, here, if we feed in this new image of orange to the machine without its label, the machine should be able to predict the correct label based on all of its training.

This is the concept of supervised learning, where we train the machine using labeled data and then use this training to find new insights.

Now, supervised learning can again be divided into two categories:

Regression
Classification
Moving on in this machine learning tutorial, we will understand these two comprehensively.
